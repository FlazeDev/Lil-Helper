# LIL HELPER
A macropad with 12 keys and an encoder. I used Kicad, onshape and kmk to make it.

# INSPIRATION
I do video editing, 3d modelling, making games, music, and studying too. So, I needed something that could increase my efficiency, and here it is, my lil helper.

# CAD
I made the CAD using onshape(too dumb to learn freecad and my pc didnt have enough space for fusion in my c drive). Took me waayy too long, but its done.

# PCB
Made the PCB using Kicad, the wiring is horrendous but it works.

# FIRMWARE
I used kmk to make firmware since im already familiar with python.
